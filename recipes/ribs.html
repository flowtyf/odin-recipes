        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is an easy way to make Korean short ribs. You can also substitute chicken breast or sliced rib-eye for the short ribs. 
            If you use chicken or rib-eye, you must add thinly sliced green onion tops. 
            This can also be broiled in the oven for the same amount of time.</p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>¾ cup soy sauce</li>
            <li>¾ cup water</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons white vinegar</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sesame oil</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Pour soy sauce, water, vinegar, and sesame oil into a large, non-metallic bowl. Whisk in onion, garlic, brown sugar, white sugar,
                 and pepper, whisking until sugars dissolve. 
                 Submerge ribs in the marinade. Cover the bowl and refrigerate 7 to 12 hours; the longer, the better.</li>
            <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat.</li>
            <li>Remove ribs from marinade and shake off excess; discard marinade.</li>
            <li>Cook on the preheated grill until the meat is no longer pink, 5 to 7 minutes per side.</li>

        </ol>
